# Heart-Disease-Prediction
For the project statement, I have used the heart disease dataset from
kaggle to create a model using Logistic Regression, which is a classification model.
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary,
Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute,
but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to
the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
The purpose of the model is to predict whether a person has a heart disease by predicting the
target value (0 or 1) based other attributes such as cholesterol level, Blood pressure etc.
